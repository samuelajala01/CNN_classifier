# Object Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project implements an object classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python, trained on a dataset of labeled images. The classifier is capable of recognizing various objects in images with high accuracy. It uses the Cifar-10 dataset to classify up to ten different Everyday objects.
The different classes are: 'airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'


## Features
- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN model.
- Provides functionalities for data preprocessing, including image augmentation and normalization.
- Implements a customizable CNN architecture to accommodate different dataset characteristics and classification tasks.
- Supports model evaluation and performance metrics calculation.
- Includes scripts for model inference on new images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- (Optional) GPU support for accelerated training (e.g., NVIDIA CUDA)
